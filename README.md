# Games-made
A folder filled with remade games coded in Java and developed by Brett Caban

The programs made are on Java. There are three programs. The first one is a remake of Atari's Space Invaders. The second one is a remake of Atari's Pong. The third one is a program called DrunkenBug. It's a program that simulates the movement of a drunken bug in a floor. The bug will move randomly around the floor until it touches every tile atleast once.

Space Invaders was done as a class project, while the other two were done for fun! I am currently working on a remake of the classic board game Chess.
